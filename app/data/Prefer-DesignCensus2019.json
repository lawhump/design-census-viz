Most interior designers do not solve for ergonomics or flow as it pertains to the core function of a space, whether for business or recreational use, opting instead to spec furniture they've only seen online, or even to reverse-engineer and plagiarize iconic designs. Classical geometry and basic mathematics are now often viewed as unnecessary or optional, which creates real problems in execution. The result is a world cluttered with evermore pointless deployments of money and materials that serve little purpose besides looking """"good"""" from one angle only. The reality is that resources are finite, the world is getting more crowded, and economic disparity continues to grow. Those at the top of the food chain continue to gain cultural and economic hegemony, while those at the bottom are more and more easily placated by superficial, aspirational cultural values. Meanwhile, the ancient resources of reason, geometry, and proportion remain available to designers who aim to solve current problems (just as they always have). Intelligent designers will always work in those realms, so there's actually no reason to worry more at present than we ever have in the past.",3D printing|AI / Machine learning|AR / VR|Automation|Biological / Genetic design|Collaborative design software|Conversational interfaces|Energy technology|Facial recognition / Biometrics|Image recognition|Miniaturization / Nanotechnology|Networked devices / Internet of Things|Online behavior tracking / Modeling|Parametric design|Telepresence / Virtual workspaces|Ubiquitous computing,Adaptability (to tech / social change)|Communication / Listening|Cross-cultural skills,Work / Career|Family / Friends / Pets|Downtime

Everything looks the same! But it's happening for a very important reason: Accessibility needs and UX/UI. Both introduce a very strict set of rules and limitations on a designer. UX/UI because interacting with a computer and a website is an unnatural experience, and in order for people to understand how to work with a website, you either need to explicitly teach them or rely on existing patterns. Accessibility because there are a wide range of disabilities that effect everything from color to sound. It's great for the user, but it's also leading to a very same-y landscape. Speaking honestly? It's kind of awesome. Web design is a baby-new field compared to the others. It's not often you get a chance to see the point where a field strikes balance between art and necessity, where others have had theirs figured out for decades (sometimes centuries!)

All the stuff being mined and shipped and driven and sold, is all designed. Designers are literally the only people who can save the planet. But I continually see bad """"green"""" solutions that actually are WORSE for the planet. I with AIGA would do a conference on this issue and bring in a bunch of experts (mostly not designers) who know what works and what does not on materials used in print, packaging, and product design. Have them talk to designers about stuff like: Cotton is a terrible thing to use for reusable sacks! Even organic cotton. It pollutes way way more then, seemingly horrible plastic based non woven cloth bags (the cheap ones) which can be recycled. I want to see design embrace science and facts more and less knee jerk reactions to solve our pollution and global warming problems. That stupid garbage patch thing that was a total failure is another example of no science but a budget and a bad idea. Designers have been making garbage patch machines but we need to know the facts before we even begin to design solutions for all the things design has helped make that are destroying the planet!",Energy technology|Image recognition|Networked devices / Internet of Things|Quantum computing|Ubiquitous computing,Adaptability (to tech / social change)|Empathy|Systems thinking,Family / Friends / Pets|Hobbies|Downtime
