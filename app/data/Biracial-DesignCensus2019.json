    "I feel the most critical issues/challenges currently facing design are:__1": "We're rightly emphasizing diversity & inclusion, yet do nothing to address that marginalized individuals have different communication styles, and being heard can be difficult. Some don't know the \"\"rules\"\" for collaboration, had to aggressively assert themselves to gain opportunities, but create conflict. For many, used to being or feeling silenced, being heard and respected is practically a life/death experience. Workplaces need to have answers for this and conflict resolution. Many survivors of sexual harassment or abuse do not receive justice, may go into new workplaces without support. Non-white races may feel othered. Economically disadvantaged may, as well, plus lack support to participate in the workplace.  Trauma survivors carry an invisible disability and stigma that workplaces often exacerbate. These are areas I work to illuminate, but feel alone, my voice rarely heard. I'd love to learn how to better advocate.",

I feel it could be that things are moving smoothly within companies that they somehow seem to have forgotten that design was part of that process and are feeling that they may have done it on  their own.  It could be the ebb & flow of design, which could be an issue in upcoming years for designers, but I think the progression with AR/VR, 3D and animation are going to be some of the fields that will see an increase in design employment and again print and some web may see a decrease...however, I feel there is always a spot for print design no matter how digital the world becomes!

I made the transition from graphic to UX design with my most recent job change after 17 years. It's been rewarding but challenging and I constantly reflect on the impacts of the shifting landscape. I also teach as an adjunct and consider the impacts there as well. The AIGA Futures papers are awesome and feel so timely and relevant to me, and are just full of incredible insight and guidance. I'm really pleased to see AIGA weighing in and showing leadership in this conversation!",

Designers are putting a leg under capitalism every day, making so much money for huge corporations every day, and creating SO much waste, yet we're talking about diversity/design for good as if it's something aspirational/fun instead of something we should have implemented 50 years ago. The industry is majority white and does little to try and change that, which has a huge impact on the lack of awareness of social impact. It is historically communities of color who are the most negatively impacted by capitalism, environmental issues, and the reinforcement of racists stereotypes in the media. All of which are directly related to the lack of representation at agencies, design firms, and within AIGA. There's a lack of trust between these institutions and communities of color that can't be rebuilt by Tweeting about diversity/sharing a POCI list. People need to get paid to speak at events, especially when the ticket prices are hundreds to thousands of dollars. There needs to be more transparency on membership dues-especially when everyone across chapters is volunteering for free and presenters aren't getting honorariums (seriously, WHERE does all that money go?) Different perspectives need to be equally represented for panels/workshops/award shows/blog posts, and last but not least: design schools need to do a better job at teaching all of our histories and contributions to the creative industry, not just German and Swiss.",

    "I feel the most critical issues/challenges currently facing design are:__1": "As \"\"unique\"\" as everyone thinks they are, \"\"unique\"\" is becoming the norm. Logos and identities are all minimalistic, all of the video snippets we see online (from social feeds to the news) all look like they are generated from the same program using basic features. With apps like Canva and Lumen5 available to anyone, everyone is becoming a designer.  Companies don't think twice about sourcing work to Fiverr. I live in the Phoenix area and there's an abundance of contruction and new communities popping up downtown, yet all of the branding for these areas looks exactly the same. Another issue is that the upcoming generation expects to have \"\"weisure\"\" careers. They want work and leisure combined, which isn't bad to be mindful of your stress level, but the focus on \"\"leisure\"\" is exceeding actual work and jobs that should take a day to complete now go on for weeks. The level of entitlement is extreme. I also feel that \"\"graphic design\"\" has been broken out into so many little jobs that what a graphic designer did just 5-10 years ago has now been broken into a bunch of little jobs, and it's too many cooks in the kitchen, making projects take 3x longer than they should. It used to be that the graphic designer sat in on the initial brainstorm session, then was part of the creative brief, researched, mocked up and created proofs, exchanged ideas with the client and went up and back until a solution was agreed upon, then prepped files for print and digital applications, got the files to the printer, press checked, updated the website/social feed with appropriate graphics and marketing messages, and archived the files. Now, there are people with specific jobs at each step of the way. \"\"Graphic Design\"\" has been so liquidated, I don't even know what the role entails anymore. It's become a very limited/limiting job with very little room for creativity. Designers are given a creative brief someone else created, with another person's research in place, given colors and fonts to use, and then told to hand their work off to yet another person to deal with print, and another person for digital assets.  Our industry has been so watered down, no one really knows their role anymore, and it's definitely grating on our confidence and creativity. People are \"\"designing\"\" on their phones without thought or theory, and this progression (easy and cheap) is killing our industry of skilled, educated, visionary designers.",

By frequently pumping out a thousand junior UX designers, the job market is clogged up from those bootcamp-students.  Whereas, if 24 junior UX designers completed two+ years earning an Associate of Applied Science degree, the opportunities in the junior market are gobbled up by the bootcamp-students.  We ACC grads are having a tough time landing jobs.  Too much competition from General Assembly for junior UX jobs.   By over-saturating the job market, the salaries for UX will go down just like Graphic Design salaries did from over-saturation.  The value of earning an AAS degree from accredited learning institution means \"\"almost nothing.\"\"  In fact, people are jumping on the UX train from no training at all.

Lack of representation as a freelance/self-employed designer, and lack of support groups for reflection as a sole proprietor. Responsible for too much --> regulating work hours/days to prevent burn-out and maintain creative inspiration/drive, manage incoming and working multiple projects at once, securely store design assets for clients, administrative duties like writing emails and providing tech support to clients, setting and re-setting boundaries with clients, and allotting time to scope out potential clients and meet-up.",
