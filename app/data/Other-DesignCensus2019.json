This is a two-fold effort because it requires both HIRING designers of diverse backgrounds and enabling those designers to design for people who are not centered in our society (i.e., white, male, straight, American, able-bodied, neurotypical, etc.). But in order to really hire and retain diverse designers, we need to talk about a living wage for designers so that people who do not come from privileged backgrounds can afford to enter the field. And we need to educate all designers on unconscious bias. In the 90s, it was estimated that design was 93% white. That means that our entire visual language is centering White culture, and we are failing to effectively reach other races and cultures in our visual language.",AI / Machine learning|Image recognition|Networked devices / Internet of Things,Empathy|Leadership|Systems thinking,Work / Career|Family / Friends / Pets|Downtime

Further, the term 'designer' is too ambiguous and we as an industry do a dis-service to ourselves by not having proper and cohesive nomenclature that differentiates one designer from another - this survey was a class example of my point - Much of the work and the role I have played over 30 years is not included in your categories of description - Your vertical are still way too traditional and not encompassing of the market place. I have spent the majority of my life doing below the line 'design' and creating international product launches for major brands that then translate into consumer experiences on any platforms.
