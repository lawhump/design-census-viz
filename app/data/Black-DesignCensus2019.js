    "I feel the most critical issues/challenges currently facing design are:__1": "The biggest issue is how poorly designed the hiring process is in the US. Too many jobs are being posted and filled by recruiters or people who have no idea what they're talking about or what to look for. New job titles with the same skills get invented, and recruiters look for that new title instead of the skills. No one is willing to train anyone on the job anymore. Applicant tracking software means no one gets a submission seen by human eyes. In addition, design seems overwhelmingly filled by people in roles who are either white or (east/far east) Asian, but people who are Black or Hispanic are few and far between. This is a bigger issue than gender inequality, IMO, because there are fewer chances for people to understand cultural differences and communication styles between the different groups. When hiring managers encounter them, they feel that designers are not a good \"\"fit\"\"; but the truth is they simply aren't used to them.",

    "I feel the most critical issues/challenges currently facing design are:__1": "A huge problem for design is a lack of management training and the tendency to chose managers based on their skill as designers rather than their ability and willingness to manage people and the functions of departments. While great designers are an incredible asset, if that person if a poor manager the worth of the designer as well as the growth and productivity of the design department can be undermined. On the other hand, a great manager may have an outstanding design department even if the manager isn't a 'star' designer.  Another critical issue facing design is the crazy pace of production. There is often too little time to think. Constant motion is expected and evaluated as a sign of productivity. It isn't. Constant multi-tasking is the death of innovation and creativity. Finally, it is not good that the hiring of designers is constricted by resume bots and HR reps who hardly understand the job descriptions they are hiring a designer for. Designers are being pigeon-holed. People are only allowed to do what they have done. Creative minds aren't being given a chance to try new work.",

Diversity without inclusion is not just an question of semantics, but a dismissal of systemic changes. Diversity lacks meaning, since it often becomes a conversation for marginalized groups (as though it is solely their responsibility) and often results in little to no systemic changes (i.e paid internships, parental leave, hiring process/ethics, etc). It doesn't address the low retention of marginalized employees or even lack of opportunities for promotion & growth.

This dynamic leads to exploitation of young designers and artists who know little about inter-industry dynamics and social expectation. In short, the industry milks us for student debt, we graduate, can't find work without settling for internships that pay barely above minimum wage or attempt to take ownership of our personal content while employed. The design field is also rife with folks who have NO SHAME in stealing art from independent freelancers on multiple platforms, rather than research and design their own. Accountability is needed.",
