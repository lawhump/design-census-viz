While they are tools to make our lives better we are wired to the default of looking into our phone when we are bored and going down the rabbit hole of notifications among other things. That's a dangerous place to be in. How do we make sure we are working for the users while also moving the business forward (to get that seat at the table)? It's a tricky, fine line that many designers face. Additionally, a problem not mentioned in the previous question is access to salaried design work. It's evident that design is in high demand, but the lack of desire to hire and train newer designers is not. Many companies will trash applications that demonstrate little work experience through ATS. Or their job listing itself will ask for a minimum of four years and many people will not apply to it out of feeling unqualified. Junior designers should be sought out and trained because in a few years they will be the industry. There are a plethora of design jobs out there, but they all want people that have been present in the industry for years... that's a small selection of people vs the number of junior designers that want to put in the work and want to get better. There are plenty of issues in design; based on where you are in your career and the kind of industry you work in, some may not be noticeable. It's a matter of perspective.",

Most of our government organizations, if they have any technological systems, are running on million-dollar COBOL mainframes that look like Ataris.

    "I feel the most critical issues/challenges currently facing design are:__1": "I believe one of the most critical issues is changing what was previously designed. Historically designers seemingly designed without mind to usability by different sexes and people with different abilities. This leaves us in a situation where we have to go back and change the fundamentals of structures and forms globally. Along with this, issues of ethics and representation are also critical. Many designers use their design skills to promote activities and actions that are bad for their health, bad for the environment, or that will cause more social issues. In terms of representation, in design school I was rarely informed on women in design, people of color in design, women of color in design, and Latino women in design. A large portion of this has to do with discrepancies in design education, but it is also lack of inclusion of designers of color and female designers.",

It did not inspire confidence in my future, and since then, I've indeed had a tough time trying to stay afloat. I've experienced a lot of unemployment and underemployment. I go without food often to save money. I'm constantly on the brink of homelessness. I'm being told often that I need to learn how to fully code in addition to my experience in front-end design. I'm at a point where I've invested so much time in the career, but I'm not able to get very far. I'm getting ready to pack it in, and try anything else. There needs to be a push for universal healthcare (as a freelancer, I've been on ACA since it started), an increase in the minimum wage, and universal basic income to account for automation. AIGA should probably function as a labor union than a social gathering.",

There's a team I work with that just don't want to involve design in the conversation nor hear design's opinion. That results in design becoming a production role with no voice on the matter. Designing without context is challenging but more challenging is to educate those folks on the value of involving design early on",

My money went into finishing my degree and paying for supplies and programs, software. I understand how much effort time and money goes into these conferences and expos, but many up and coming designers and others in a digital designing field wont have equal opportunity to learn from the best with prices constantly rising and students tickets being more than a car payment.",
